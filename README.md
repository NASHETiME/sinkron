# SINKRON
 A software that shares one mouse and one keyboard between multiple computers. Simply move your mouse between the computers effortlessly. As of now, the software has no GUI and is very much still in an extremely early development phase. It also only supports two computers at a time, a single client with a single server.
 

## Setup
 1. Install the required libraries
 2. Connect the computers to the same network and change the IP adresses accordingly
 3. Run the server script on the host computer
 4. Run the client script on the computer you want to share preipherals with
 
 
## In future, I am expecting to add:
  - Clipboard sharing
  - Complete keyboard functionality
  - Ability to add more computers
  - Ability to customize the arrangement of the screens
